# parallel

A simple way to run several functions at once.

Functions are not actually executed simultaneously, but rather this API will automatically switch between them whenever they yield (e.g. whenever they call `coroutine.yield`, or functions that call that - such as `os.pullEvent` - or functions that call that, etc - basically, anything that causes the function to "pause").

Each function executed in "parallel" gets its own copy of the event queue, and so "event consuming" functions (again, mostly anything that causes the script to pause - eg `os.sleep`, `rednet.receive`, most of the `turtle` API, etc) can safely be used in one without affecting the event queue accessed by the other.

##### ⚠ warning

When using this API, be careful to pass the functions you want to run in parallel, and not the result of calling those functions.

For instance, the following is correct:

```lua
local function do_sleep() sleep(1) end
parallel.waitForAny(do_sleep, rednet.receive)
```

but the following is NOT:

```lua
local function do_sleep() sleep(1) end
parallel.waitForAny(do_sleep(), rednet.receive)
```

### Changes

- New in version 1.2

| waitForAny(...) | Switches between execution of the functions, until any of them finishes. |
| waitForAll(...) | Runs several functions in parallel, until all of them are finished. |

### waitForAny(...)
Switches between execution of the functions, until any of them finishes. If any of the functions errors, the message is propagated upwards from the `parallel.waitForAny` call.

### Parameters

- ... `function` The functions to run in parallel.

### Usage

-

Print a message every second until the `q` key is pressed.

```lua
local function tick()
 while true do
 os.sleep(1)
 print("Tick")
 end
end
local function wait_for_q()
 repeat
 local _, key = os.pullEvent("key")
 until key == keys.q
 print("Q was pressed!")
end

parallel.waitForAny(tick, wait_for_q)
print("Everything done!")
```

### waitForAll(...)
Runs several functions in parallel, until all of them are finished.

If any of the functions errors, the other functions are not resumed, and the error is propagated upwards.

##### ⚠ warning

While any number of functions can be run in parallel, running too many things in parallel can sometimes cause issues:

- Computers only buffer 256 events at a time. Trying to run several hundred functions in parallel (particularly when calling peripheral methods) can cause the event queue to fill up, resulting in events being dropped, and programs getting stuck.
- Computers only run 16 HTTP requests at a time. Trying to run more than that in parallel will have no effect.

### Spawning new parallel functions

In some cases, you may want to start running additional functions in parallel from an existing `parallel.waitForAll` call. Every function passed to `waitForAll` can accept a `spawn` argument, which can be called to spawn new parallel functions.

```lua
parallel.waitForAll(function(spawn)
 spawn(function() sleep(1); print("Finished 1") end)
 spawn(function() sleep(2); print("Finished 2") end)
end)
```

### Parameters

- ... function(spawn: function(fn: `function`, ...: `any`)) The functions to run in parallel.

### Usage

-

Start off two timers and wait for them both to run.

```lua
local function a()
 os.sleep(1)
 print("A is done")
end
local function b()
 os.sleep(3)
 print("B is done")
end

parallel.waitForAll(a, b)
print("Everything done!")
```

-

Generate a list of functions to run in parallel.

```lua
local funcs = {}
for i = 1, 5 do
 table.insert(funcs, function()
 sleep(math.random())
 print("Finished " .. i)
 end)
end

parallel.waitForAll(table.unpack(funcs))
print("Everything done!")
```

-

Run new functions in parallel from within `waitForAll`.

```lua
parallel.waitForAll(function(spawn)
 for i = 1, 5 do
 spawn(function()
 sleep(math.random())
 print("Finished " .. i)
 end)
 end
end)
print("Everything done!")
```

### Changes

- Changed in version 1.120.0: Added ability to spawn new parallel functions.
